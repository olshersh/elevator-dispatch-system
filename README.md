# elevator-dispatch-system
Designed and iimplemented a scalable elevator dispatch system. It assigns requests sequentially and selects the optimal elevator based on the minimum number of intermediate stops required to reach the pickup floor.

This project demonstrates **O(1) cost calculation** and **O(logN) scheduling** using binary search algorithm ('bisect').
